# COPS Algorithm Contribution Challenge

This repository includes your first challenge of this week. To accomplish this
challenge successfully you had to get a PR(pull request) merged into this
repository which includes an algorithm from the list given below. Your PR
is required to have proper title and description and make sure the algorithm you
will be adding must go in the proper folder.

## Guidelines

- Your PR should include only one algorithm from the given list.
- You should commit your code file in the respective language folder in the repository.
- Scores of different algorithms are also listed in the algorithms list.
- Try to write code on your own rather than copying it from other sources.
- You can make a new folder for any language of your choice if it does not exist in the repo.
